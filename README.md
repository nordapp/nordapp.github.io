The project contains some tests using Karaf and OSGi in a cloud project. We decided not using OSGi but doing our work with Akka and some parts of the the Netflix OSS.

Some of the projects like 'hateoas' are first steps to build an embeddable cloud with a small footprint. Some of the dependencies have to be removed as far as the required microservices are available.
