{"name":"NordApp Project","tagline":"OSGi bundles for the Internet-of-things","body":"### Welcome to the NordApp Project\r\n\r\nWe create software to support the use of the Internet-of-Things.\r\n\r\nThere are great, stable OSGi Projects available. We like them very much and use some of them by ourself too. This project has a special intent. Software often has dependencies to other projects. This doesn't matter because there is so much disk space and RAM everywhere. A dependency to an open source project claims no additional cost. There is no need to install such projects because there are tools like Maven that does the job for you.\r\n\r\nBut, if you want to install a small footprint only or you have the need for a few well-known services, there must be a construction kit that supports this.\r\n\r\n### Util\r\n\r\nSome basic concepts to avoid dependencies.\r\n\r\n### Step\r\n\r\nA multi tenant and serverside scriptable platform to develop and test prototypes. The prototypes are quick and easily realized in JavaScript. There is access to other OSGi bundles from JavaScript.\r\n\r\nStep can be used in production environment as server to support data driven WebApps.\r\n\r\n### WebPage\r\n\r\nA REST based web service to build WebApps on top of Step. The WebApps can be used as user interface of the services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
